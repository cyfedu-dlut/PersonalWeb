excerpt: 'The emergence of on-demand ride pooling services allows each
vehicle to serve multiple passengers at a time, thus increasing driversâ€™ income and enabling passengers to travel at lower prices than
taxi/car on-demand services (only one passenger can be assigned
to a car at a time like UberX and Lyft).
Although on-demand ride pooling services can bring so many
benefits, ride pooling services need a well-defined matching strategy to maximize the benefits for all parties (passengers, drivers,
aggregation companies and environment), in which the regional
dispatching of vehicles has a significant impact on the matching and
revenue. Existing algorithms often only consider revenue maximization, which makes it difficult for requests with unusual distribution
to get a ride. How to increase revenue while ensuring a reasonable
assignment of requests brings a challenge to ride pooling service
companies (aggregation companies). In this paper, we propose a
framework for vehicle dispatching for ride pooling tasks, which
splits the city into discrete dispatching regions and uses the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to dispatch vehicles in these
regions. We also consider the mutual information (MI) between
vehicle and order distribution as the intrinsic reward of the RL algorithm to improve the correlation between their distributions, thus
ensuring the possibility of getting a ride for unusually distributed
requests. In experimental results on a real-world taxi dataset, we
demonstrate that our framework can significantly increase revenue up to an averag'
