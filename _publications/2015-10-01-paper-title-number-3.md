excerpt: 'Salient Object Detection (SOD) benefits from the guidance
of global context to further enhance performance. However, most works
focus on treating the top-layer features through simple compression and
nonlinear processing as the global context, which inevitably lacks the
integrity of the object. Moreover, directly integrating multi-level features
with global context is ineffective for solving semantic dilution. Although
the global context is considered to enhance the relationship among salient
regions to reduce feature redundancy, equating high-level features with
global context often results in suboptimal performance. To address these
issues, we redefine the role of global context within the network and
propose a new method called Global-Guided Weighted Enhancement
Network (GWENet). We first design a Deep Semantic Feature Extractor (DSFE) to enlarge the receptive field of network, laying the foundation for global context extraction. Secondly, we construct a Global
Perception Module (GPM) for global context modeling through pixellevel correspondence, which employs a global sliding weighted technique
to provide the network with rich semantics and acts on each layer to
enhance SOD performance by Global Guidance Flows (GGFs). Lastly,
to effectively merge multi-level features with the global context, we introduce a Comprehensive Feature Enhancement Module (CFEM) that integrates all features within the module through 3D convolution, producing more robust feature maps. Extensive experiments on five challenging
benchmark datasets demonstrate that GWENet achieves state-of-the-art
results.'
