excerpt: 'A crucial issue in multimodal language processing
is representation learning. Previous works joint training the
multimodal and unimodal tasks to learn the consistency and
difference of modality representations. However, due to the lack of
cross-modal interaction, the extraction of complementary features
between modalities is not sufficient. Moreover, during multimodal
fusion, the generated multimodal embeddings may be redundant,
and unimodal representations also contain noise information,
which negatively influence the final sentiment prediction. To this
end, we construct a Modality-Complementary and EliminatingRedundancy multi-task learning model (MCER), and additionally
add a cross-modal task to learn complementary features between
two modal pairs through gated transformer. Then use two label
generation modules to learn modality-specific and modalitycomplementary representations. Additionally, we introduce the
multimodal information bottleneck (MIB) in both multimodal
and unimodal tasks to filter out noise information in unimodal
representations as well as learn powerful and sufficient multimodal
embeddings that is free of redundancy. Last, we conduct extensive
experiments on two popular sentiment analysis benchmarks,
MOSI and MOSEI. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model significantly outperforms the current strong baselines.'
