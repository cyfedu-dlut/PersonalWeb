This ppt primarily discusses the relevant research and methods related to video stabilization and stabilization technology. The following are the main points summarized: Introduction to Video Stabilization/Stabilization: The definitions of video stabilization and anti-shake technology and their significance. The classification of techniques includes Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS), Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), and Accelerometer-based Stabilization (AIS), each with its advantages and disadvantages. The anti-shake approach of AIS includes motion estimation, smoothing processing, and stable generation. Application Fields: Video stabilization technology has wide-ranging applications in several fields, such as the OIS anti-shake processing in the iPhone 14 Pro. Recent Notable Works: A list of significant research achievements in the field of video stabilization in recent years, including 3D video stabilization, depth camera stabilization, and online video stabilization. Core Concepts of MeshFlow and Real-time Video-Stitching: MeshFlow focuses on online video stabilization with minimal latency. Real-time Video-Stitching involves the computation of affine transformations and accumulation transformations among multiple cameras. Core Concept of FuSta.
